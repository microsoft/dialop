# Play against GPT-3

Get started and play the games with GPT-3 as an assistant:
```
pip install -e .
vim dialop/.api_key
python dialop/play_gpt3.py --game {optimization, planning, mediation}
```

# Overview

- `games`: define game logic, environment data generation
- `envs`: text-based interfaces for games
- `apps`: web app interfaces for games for human-human play


| Name         | Description   | Human UI           | Agent Text Interface | Hosted UI             |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `Optimization` | Assign the best reviewers for conference papers | ![Optimization UI](assets/optimization_ui.png) | ![Optimization Text Interface](assets/optimization_text.png) | [Play now](http://reviewer-matching.herokuapp.com/) |
| `Planning` | Plan the best itinerary with the least travel and price | ![Planning UI](assets/planning_ui.png) | ![Planning Text Interface](assets/planning_text.png) | [Play now](https://itinerary-planning.herokuapp.com/)
| `Mediation` | Coordinate a set of group flights that works well for everyone | ![Mediation UI](assets/mediation_ui.png) | ![Mediation Text Interface](assets/mediation_text.png) | [Play now](https://collaborative-dialogue.herokuapp.com/)

**To play against yourself with the text-based environment:**
```
python dialop/play.py --game {optimization, planning, mediation}
```
**To play against yourself with the web UI:**
```
cd dialop/apps
game={optimization, planning, mediation} flask run
```
For Planning, you'll need to input a MapboxGL access key in `static/client.js` to show the map on the agent side.
