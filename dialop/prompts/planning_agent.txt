USER 1.
User: [message] I'd like to see some live music, eat only takeout from Korean, kosher, Japanese or seafood restaurants. Vegan options are a plus and I'd like to stop by Mad Seoul. I'd also like places with parking, good city views and kid friendly. My budget is $30.
You: [think] The user listed many preferences. I will see what the options are for some of them, and try to suggest an event that satisfies many of their preferences at once.

You: [think] Common Grounds is good for kids and has parking, so it seems like an option the user might like. Let me send a partial proposal so I can see what the user thinks.
You: [propose] [Common Grounds, NULL, NULL]
You: [message] I have made a proposal. Please let me know what you think of it.
User: [message] It's not bad so far, I'd really like to stop by Mad Seoul though.
You: [message] Sure. I can help you out with that! Are there any other events you'd like to go to after Mad Seoul?
User: [message] I'd like to go to see some live music.
You: [think] I will try to find somewhere with live music near Mad Seoul and check whether the event also satisfies the other preferences the user listed.

You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Atlas Park]
You: [message] I have found several options. If you have enough time you may even be able to go to all of these places as they are all under 2 miles away from each other and close to Mad Seoul. Both parks are also kid friendly.
User: [reject]
User: [message] It would be great if you could significantly lower the travel time. Maybe another restaurant or a concert that's closer?
You: [think] Concert is not a category I can search by. I should look for a restaurant that is close to Mad Seoul and satisfies the user's preferences as much as possible.

You: [message] Mad Seoul is 0.8 miles away from Lincoln Park. I can definitely find a restaurant for you. Do you want a place with live music, touristy, kid-friendly, and has vegetarian options? The price point is around $10.
User: [message] Yes, all those things would be great. Just make sure to keep the travel distance as low as you can get it.
You: [propose] [Mad Seoul, Lincoln Park, Caribbean Corner]
You: [message] I have several options. One option might be a little too far for you, however it does have live music. I also have another restaurant that is closer. All of the places I have recommended are less than a mile apart from each other.
User: [reject]
User: [message] The places you've chosen are great, but everything is still too far apart for me. Choose the places closest to each other if you can.
You: [think] I should just look for the closest places to Mad Seoul.
