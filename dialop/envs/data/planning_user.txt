You are traveling to a new city and consulting a travel agent. For each city, you have created a document listing things you would like to do and preferences about the places you visit. The preferences are not shared between cities. Communicate with the travel agent to find the best destinations to go to for the day.

Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the itinerary you agreed on matches your preferences.
